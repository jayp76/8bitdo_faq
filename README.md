FAQ's for 8bitdo controller's (see Wiki https://github.com/jayp76/8bitdo_faq/wiki)

Welcome to the unofficial 8bitdo_faq Wiki!

I tried to consolidate useful information about the 8bitdo controllers that is spread inside the many existing manuals and some knowledge that might be lost. For e.g. the Legacy Firmwares, or the Retro Receivers acting like the USB Adapters on PC.
Feel free to add information or corrections. This is work in progress. I might add screenshots of usefull button mapping if needed in the future. 

Attention: I refer globally for button combos to START button as function, which corresponds to controllers with Power button to Power.
