## Firmware Update combo:
L + R + START -> Connect to USB

### Except the Lite controller due to missing POWER button 
L + R + HOME

## Rescue Flash (Alternative Flash Combo, for e.g. when controller does not Power up by START)
Holding L + R -> Connect to USB

## Best practise:
Use the individual installer for your corresponding controller, instead of the "Upgrade Tool" (at this point it is buggy and sometime bricks controllers -> See Rescue Flash)

## Delete Bluetooth Pairing and re-pair
Press and hold the SELECT/Pair button 2 to 3 seconds, LED will rapidly blink

## **STAR** and **HOME** Buttons
May not be usable on different consoles/systems. For e.g. the MiSTer project.

## Force Power off / factory reset
To restore to factory settings (or force power off) hold down the START/Power button for 8 seconds.

## HOME button combos
HOME button combos and controllers with HOME Button can trigger the HOME/In-game menu on different consoles
like the Nintendo Switch, Playstation Classic Mini, Mega Drive/Genesis Classic Mini, NES Classic Mini and the Retron 5.
Look for the possible button combos in the FAQ sections.
